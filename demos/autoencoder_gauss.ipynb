    "# Outlier Detection (Gaussian Toy Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the basics of outlier detection in the context of anomaly detection. \n",
    "We will use simple Gaussian toy data to demonstrate the basic concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the outlier detection version of anomaly detection, we train a model to learn what our background looks like\n",
    "and then classify things as anomalous based on how 'disimilar' they look as compared to the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially this means we are defining events that have low probability density under the background to be anomalous. \n",
    "In this case, we are generating our own Gaussian toy data, so we know the true probability distribution of the background.\n",
    "However, in realistic physics examples this is usually not the case. \n",
    "One must therefore train a machine learning model to learn the background probability distribution, or an equivalent proxy, from a sample of background events.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common proxy used to learn the background distribution is a type of neural network called an autoencoder.\n",
    "Autoencoders do not directly learn the probability distribution. Instead they are trained to take the input data, compress it down into some smaller representation\n",
    "and decompress it back out to recover the original inputs. The idea is that by forcing the model to learn to compress the data, it will force it to learn its underlying structure.\n",
    "If the model is trained only on background events, it should hopefully learn how to do this compression task for background events but not for signal events.\n",
    "Therefore, there should be a larger difference between the model input and output on signal events. \n",
    "This difference, called the reconstruction loss, can therefore be used as an anomaly score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that unlike weak supervision, we expect this type model to always be worse than a supervised classifier because it never sees signal events during the training.\n",
    "However, it can usuaully be trained in an easier fashion, (because one only needs to find a sample of background events) and has a stable performance instead of varying depending on the amount of signal present. "
