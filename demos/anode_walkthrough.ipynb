    "# ANODE Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple conceptual guide through how the [ANODE method](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.075042) for anomaly detection works. The notebook is oversimplified such that it does not make use of all optimization measures implemented in the main paper. It rather shows the core concept while hiding the technical implementation details behind a scikit-learn style API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core assumption of ANODE is that you have a resonant feature $m$, in which a potential (a-priori unknown) signal process is localized. Furthermore, we want to make use of extra dimensions, our auxiliary features $x$, to discriminate between such a signal and the background. This is illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![resonant anomaly detection](images/resonant_anomaly_detection.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We would now like to learn to distinguish signal from background in a data-driven manner. An optimal test statistic between signal and background would be the likelihood ratio $\\frac{p_{sig}}{p_{bkg}}$. But for this we would need to know how the signal looks like. What we can try to estimate instead is the data-to-background likelihood ratio, which is monotolically linked to the signal-to-background one (data=sig+bkg): $\\frac{p_{data}}{p_{bkg}} = \\frac{f_{sig} p_{sig} + (1- f_{sig}) p_{bkg}}{p_{bkg}} = f_{sig} \\frac{p_{sig}}{p_{bkg}} + (1 - f_{sig})$ where $f_{sig}$ is the (unknown) signal fraction in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this aim, we first divide the $m$ spectrum into a signal region (SR), in which we want to look for a localized signal, and the complementary sidebands (SB). Then we train a conditional normalizing flow to learn the background distribution $p_{bkg}(x|m)$ in $x$ as a function of $m$ from the SB and interpolate into the SR. Within the SR, we can learn the data likelihood directly, also as a function of $m$: $p_{data}(x|m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then simply take the ratio of these two likelihoods for every data point in the test set. This is an anomaly score that we can select on and it will thus increase the relative fraction of signal over background.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are now illustrated via code below."

There the same likelihood ratio between data and background is learned, but it is approximated via a classifier that learns to distinguish samples from the two distributions, rather than modeling the two distributions separately and taking the ratio. In practice, neural networks are seen as more powerful in learning likelihood ratios than two separate flows. However, there might still be use cases where the ANODE approach could be more suitable."
